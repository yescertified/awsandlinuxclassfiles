Use this simple app in this workshop by AWS to test App Runner with Nodejs code from Github. The code to use is provided in the workshop and I also now have it here in Github https://github.com/yescertified/simple-express-app:

Git Commands for uploading to Github:
cd <to source code folder>
git init
git status
git add . (to put these files in what is called the staging area)
git commit -M "Custom message" (to commit all these file into the GitHub folder i.e. the hidden .git folder)
***in case you get an error that asks you to do the messages below, do it, just add your email and name as required.
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Yes, skipping (git branch -M main) since I'm keeping master as my master name and not changing to main.
git remote add origin <remote url, get this from your github repo>
git push -u origin <branch name e.g master or main>
*If asked for authentication, make sure you are logged into github on your default browser.
*All your files should now be in github after that, just refresh your github page in your browser :)
