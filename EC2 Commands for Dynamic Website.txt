Amazon Linux 2 AMI-Make sure to update the connection credentials (username and password) in the config file of your source code:
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2
sudo yum install -y httpd mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl is-enabled httpd
sudo aws s3 cp s3://dynamicappmkmk --region us-east-1 /var/www/html/ --recursive

Before adding data into the database, make sure to run the script to create the "test" database and "user" table first:
ec2-3-84-186-214.compute-1.amazonaws.com/install.php

Test using this link:
ec2-3-84-186-214.compute-1.amazonaws.com/public/index.php. Important! I recommend you check "http.conf" in Apache and make sure to add the following lines before creating an AMI to use for Autoscaling.....
AcceptFilter http none
AcceptFilter https none
After adding and before creating an AMI of this, make sure to create and instance, add it to a load balancer and test from the load balancer to make sure you are not getting a case where a load balancer shows a blank screen when you enter information on the dynamic website form and click submit ....




For Mysql - Lets use MySQL Workbench to test and see data in our database 
show databases;
use test;
show tables;
describe users;
select * from users;


If load balancer shows a blank screen when you enter information on the form and click submit, a troubleshooting step is to edit http.conf in Apache and make sure to add the following lines (usually, this works if you just refresh the page).....
AcceptFilter http none
AcceptFilter https none
